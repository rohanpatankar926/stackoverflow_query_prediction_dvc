"android studio emulator: WARNING: Increasing RAM size to 1024MB <p>I am trying to build my first android application in Android Studio, following the tutorial <a href=""https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html</a>, using AndroidStudio 2.1.2. </p> <p>Whenever I run the emulator, I get this error message:</p> <blockquote> <p>Android Emulator could not allocate 1.0 GB of memory for the current AVD configuration. Consider adjusting the RAM size of your AVD in the AVD Manager. Error detail: QEMU 'pc.ram': Cannot allocate memory</p> </blockquote> <p>Decreasing the size of the memory on the Nexus5x emulator has no effect, so the error message still says ""could not allocate 1.0 GB"", even when I adjust the memory of the AVD to 256MB. The app needs to run on Android 6.0, with a Nexus5x emulator, so I can't try with a different emulator. Any help would be much appreciated :)</p>"
<p>I would do a loop. Keep adding days until you hit a day that works.</p>
"<p>Reading your comments, i see that it is not a ZF2 error, and probably not even a third party module, so it could be an ElFinder Error. Probably it cannot find some required resources.</p> <p>Reading some code and some webdites, i think that probably you are just lacking the url option of the viewhelper, so ElFinder can find the backend route he tries to connect to. </p> <p>With the QuElFinder, the route to the connector is <code>/quelfinder/connector</code> so in your view, the code will be:</p> <pre><code>echo $this-&gt;QuElFinder('elfinder', array( 'width' =&gt; ""50%"", 'height' =&gt; '300', 'url' =&gt; '/quelfinder/connector' ) ); </code></pre> <p>Also, you should go to <code>QuElFinder/config/module.config.php</code> and check everything under </p> <pre><code> 'QuConfig'=&gt;array( 'QuElFinder'=&gt;array( </code></pre> <p>because as you can see in the QuElFinder controller, in the <code>connectorAction()</code> function, it is reading that configuration, and there is a lot of paths.</p>"
"Telegram Bot API: How to avoid Integer overflow in updates id? <p>Telegram bot api get updates function takes last update id as offest parameter. But update id is signed 32bit integer, so it is just 2147483647. Currently my bot receiving update id 348691972. 2147483647 is a small number, for example current China and India population is more then int 32.<br> What will happen when update id will overflow and how to avoid it? Is it some kind of problem 2000?</p>"
Searching and capturing a character using regular expressions Python <p>While going through one of the problems in <a href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com/" rel="nofollow">Python Challenge</a>, I am trying to solve it as follows:</p> <p>Read the input in a text file with characters as follows:</p> <pre><code>DQheAbsaMLjTmAOKmNsLziVMenFxQdATQIjItwtyCHyeMwQTNxbbLXWZnGmDqHhXnLHfEyvzxMhSXzd BEBaxeaPgQPttvqRvxHPEOUtIsttPDeeuGFgmDkKQcEYjuSuiGROGfYpzkQgvcCDBKrcYwHFlvPzDMEk MyuPxvGtgSvWgrybKOnbEGhqHUXHhnyjFwSfTfaiWtAOMBZEScsOSumwPssjCPlLbLsPIGffDLpZzMKz jarrjufhgxdrzywWosrblPRasvRUpZLaUbtDHGZQtvZOvHeVSTBHpitDllUljVvWrwvhpnVzeWVYhMPs kMVcdeHzFZxTWocGvaKhhcnozRSbWsIEhpeNfJaRjLwWCvKfTLhuVsJczIYFPCyrOJxOPkXhVuCqCUgE luwLBCmqPwDvUPuBRrJZhfEXHXSBvljqJVVfEGRUWRSHPeKUJCpMpIsrV....... </code></pre> <p>What I need is to go through this text file and pick all lower case letters that are enclosed by only three upper-case letters on each side.</p> <p>The python script that I wrote to do the above is as follows:</p> <pre><code>import re pattern = re.compile("[a-z][A-Z]{3}([a-z])[A-Z]{3}[a-z]") f = open('/Users/Dev/Sometext.txt','r') for line in f: result = pattern.search(line) if result: print result.groups() f.close() </code></pre> <p>The above given script, instead of returning the capture(list of lower case characters), returns all the text blocks that meets the regular expression criteria, like</p> <pre><code>aXCSdFGHj vCDFeTYHa nHJUiKJHo ......... ......... </code></pre> <p>Can somebody tell me what exactly I am doing wrong here? And instead of looping through the entire file, is there an alternate way to run the regular expression search on the entire file?</p> <p>Thanks</p>
